# Aspose.GIS-for-Python-Net
Aspose.GIS for Python examples, plugins and showcases.

Aspose.GIS for Python supports Python 3+, but please Python 3.8+ for these examples.
Aspose.PSD for Python is not necessary for the examples but it's used for the comparison and can be replaced by more simple and less fast library.

To run please install the following packages:

python -m pip install aspose-gis-net
python -m pip install aspose-psd-net
python -m pip install pytest
